# UstadiLink üõ†Ô∏è

### An AI-powered platform connecting learners with local artisans for micro-apprenticeships, tackling SDG 4: Quality Education.

---

## Problem Statement

Formal education often lacks pathways to practical, vocational skills. Kenya's vibrant informal "Jua Kali" sector holds immense knowledge, but it's at risk of being lost without a structured way to pass it down. UstadiLink bridges this gap, empowering a new generation with job-ready skills.

## Core Features

* **AI Curriculum Builder:** Artisans can record audio in Swahili or English, and our AI automatically transcribes and structures it into easy-to-understand "Skill Modules".
* **Hyper-Local Matchmaking:** Learners are intelligently matched with vetted artisans in their community, like here in Kitengela.
* **Micro-Apprenticeships:** A flexible system for scheduling short-term, hands-on learning sessions.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Supabase (Database, Auth, Storage)
* **AI:** OpenAI API (Whisper for Transcription, GPT-4o for Structuring)
* **Deployment:** Render
